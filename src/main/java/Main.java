/*
Things that need to be added to complete game:
- Random number in a certain range (probably 1-10) using a random number function
- Input from user to make their guess
- Conditional based on user input against actual answer
- A loop that will repeat until the correct number is guessed (probably while or do while)
- An iterator in the loop to track the number of guesses
- A conditional to prevent a repeated number from counting as another guess

Possible variables:
- randomNum (randomly chosen number to guess)
- userGuess (User's guess for the number)
- correctGuess (Boolean state for the loop to check if the user has guessed correctly)
- totalGuess (Number of attempts to guess the correct number)
- prevGuess (Store the previous guess to check it against the next guess and determine if totalGuess will be incremented)
